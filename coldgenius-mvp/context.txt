SUMMARY:
ColdGenius is a web-based application that uses Google's Gemini LLM to help users craft short, personalized, and high-performing cold emails for outreach. The platform is designed to eliminate writer’s block and automate the first step of building professional connections—sending the perfect first message.

Instead of manually writing emails, users input key details such as:
- Industry they’re targeting
- Role of the recipient
- What they're offering
- The tone of the email

ColdGenius uses this structured input to prompt Gemini to generate a concise and actionable cold email under 120 words. The output is designed to feel human, personal, and relevant—maximizing open and response rates.

---

GOALS:
- Lower the barrier to cold outreach
- Speed up the email generation process from 30 minutes to 30 seconds
- Improve email quality with high-converting copy
- Build trust and authenticity into automated communication

---

TECH STACK:
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: API Routes in Next.js (Edge functions optional)
- **AI**: Gemini Pro (via Google AI SDK / Vertex AI APIs)
- **State Management**: React Hooks (or Zustand if app scales)
- **Environment**: .env for API keys & config, Vercel or Firebase for deployment

---

AI ARCHITECTURE:
1. **Input Preprocessing**: User form fields are turned into a structured custom prompt for Gemini.
2. **Prompt Engineering**: Carefully tuned base prompt to enforce tone, brevity, and structure.
3. **API Integration**: The request is sent to Gemini Pro using a secure server-side function.
4. **Postprocessing**: The returned message is cleaned, formatted, and displayed in the UI.
5. **Feedback loop (future)**: Let users rate results to improve prompt generation over time.
